This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

HINT:
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2. Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1--
3. Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains one or more unreleased products.

Queries:
SELECT product FROM table where category='Clothing, shoes and accessories' OR 1=1--

OR 1=1  This query will take all the product from the table with all category.
--      Is a "comment" in SQL so the query will ignore all after the --
