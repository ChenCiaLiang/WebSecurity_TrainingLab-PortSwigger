This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user.

HINT :
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the login request.
2. Modify the username parameter, giving it the value: administrator'--

Queries:
SELECT user FROM users where username='administrator'-- and password='randomblablabla'

We fill the username as 'administrator' so we can login as administrator and we put -- so the password check will be ignored since
we don't know the password at all.
